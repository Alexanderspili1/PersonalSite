                        Learning about the world around me is one of the things I value most, second only to using that knowledge to <span className = "important-text">solve real problems</span>, whether for myself, my loved ones, my community, or the broader world.

                        I’m currently working toward my computer science & data science degree, with a growing interest in machine learning, neural networks, graph theory, and the design of data-intensive systems. I'm always looking for new ways to apply programming to real-world problems, and I’m especially drawn to projects that push my understanding. <span className = "important-text">If you're working on something interesting, I’d love to hear about it.</span>
